<br><br>Faldhir is a single-player 2D dungeon crawler game where you play as a lonely wanderer inside a massive cave, known as Faldhir. Many monsters lurk within, with a plethora of different treasures for the taking! Be cautious, these monsters are deadly and what nothing of you. Fight for as long as you can!
<br><br>I worked on this project with 3 other great people for my portfolio building capstone course.
