<br><br>Altius is a souls inspired game made for my intermediate game development class.  I worked with two others to create a fun game, implementing many features we've never worked with
and leraning a lot doing it.  It's not quite as full a game as we had imagined, but it turned out pretty well for just over a month of time.
<br><br>Altius features an inventory system, along with the ability to change armor and weapons, with the stats and models being reflected.  The controls are everything you'd expect from a souls-like with running,
dodge-rolling, estus-drinking, attacking, and heavy attacking.  Every attack has accurate hitboxes that are timed to activate and deactivate with the animation (i.e. what you see is what you get).  Death resets you to the beginning of the stage. There is currently no ending, but a lot of action between the start and where ever you die.
