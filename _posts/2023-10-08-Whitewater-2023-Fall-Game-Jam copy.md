<br><br>I went back to Whitewater to participate in their first Fall Game Jam of the year, working together with two other returning alumni.
<br><br>"The Killing Blow of the Dark Evil Spirit" is a live action, choose your own adventure, horror game.  It stars three programmers attempting to act, resulting in a hilarious but short game.
<br><br>This game was made in 48 hours and we collectivly have about no experience in making this type of game, especially the filming and editing.  However Adam (Zaidis) has worked on horror games before.
<br><br>I largely worked on the editing for the video clips, but also did pair programming to help solve problems in our implementation of the game's systems and logic.
