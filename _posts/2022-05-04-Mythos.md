<br><br>Mythos is a virtual CCG (Collection Card Game) where you forge your own decks to battle against another opponent for the ultimate goal of claiming victory. 
<br><br>Mythos was a large team project with 14 team members from various areas of Media Arts that was developed over the course of most of a semester.  It was our final Capstone Project for MAGD.
<br><br>I mostly worked on the networking for this game, which included a custom server executable that communicated with the game client using encrypted sockets.  Using this system users
can create accounts, save and load decks stored on a database, and queue for matchmaking, or join another player with a join code.  The server keeps tracks of your wins and losses as well.
<br><br>**UPDATE 8/26:** Mythos won Best in Show at UW-Whitewater's MAGD Expo.
