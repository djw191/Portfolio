This was a project for my advanced 3D modeling class, where we focused on sculpting models.  This helmet model is based on Master Chief's from Halo 3.  I modeled it with blender using traditional poly-modeling, and then moved it to Zbrush and added details.  The basic texturing was also done in Zbrush.
