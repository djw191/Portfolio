<br><br>This was the final project for my MAGD 272 - Game Development Course.  It's a simple 2D stealth game where you have to sneak past guards and cameras without being detected to steal data from a compound.  You can go play it right now on itch.io, it's fairly short.
<br><br>I created most of the assets myself, only the music was royalty free.
