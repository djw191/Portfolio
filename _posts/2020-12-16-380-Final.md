<br><br>This was the final project for my ARTSTDIO 380, 3D Modeling, course.  I choose to model a space craft based on a sketch I had made.  I modeled it in Maya, but I mostly use Blender now.  It was textured and mapped using Substance Painter.  Blender's Cycles renderer is extremely powerful, so I choose that for the final render seen at the top.
