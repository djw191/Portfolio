My name is Derek Woodard.  I attended UW-Whitewater, graduating in Spring 2022 Magna Cum Laude with a B.S. in Computer Science and Media Art and Game Design.  
Making games is my passion, and I find myself making whatever interests me.  I love tinkering and figuring things out for myself.
<br>I'm proficient in C++, C#, and have experience using Java, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.  For game development I'm most experienced with Unity.  For 3D I use ZBrush for sculpting and Blender for modeling and rendering.
