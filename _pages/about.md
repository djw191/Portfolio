My name is Derek Woodard.  I'm from South Milwaukee, and currently attend the University of Whitewater - Wisconsin, expecting to graduate in Spring 2022.  I enjoy making games and just making in general; tinkering and figuring things out for myself are my favorite ways to spend my time.  
<br>I'm proficient in C++, C#, and have experience using Java, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.  For game development I usually use Unity.  For 3D I use ZBrush for sculpting and Blender for modeling and rendering.
